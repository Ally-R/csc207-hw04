## Note about ALifeSim versus ALifeSimExpt
We made two main methods in order to handle testing: ALifeSim and
ALifeSimExpt. Our ALifeSim class is the same as what the assignment asked
for. Our ALifeSimExpt class semi-automates the testing process required for the
assignment. It takes similar input as ALifeSim, but does not take a
population size. Instead, it runs ALifeSim with the given inputs for
population sizes 10 and 100, for ten trials each (with different seeds each time.)
